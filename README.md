## SLURP_uncertainty_estimation

The implementations for SLURP: Side Learning Uncertainty for Regression Problems (BMVC 2021)

Check [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11182).

The three folders correspond to three different tasks. See the `README.md` in the folders for more details.

Here are some visualizations for the results of our side learner.
